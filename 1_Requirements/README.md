# OBJECTIVE
Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper.Existing system manually used control stalk to activate wiper and the process of pulling up wiper is difficult to be handled. The driver needs to switch on and off the control stalk and it will reduce the driverâ€™s concentration during the driving. Thus, this system is proposed to solve all these problems. The concept of this wiper system is similar with other conventional wiper, yet this system will be upgraded to an automatic control system by using a controller. Whenever the water hit a dedicated sensor that located on windscreen, it will send a signal to move on the wiper motor. Once water is not detected by sensor, the wiper will automatically stop. This will help the driver to give more concentration and reduce the car accident probability.

# FEATURES
A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions. The control system includes a rain sensor . detecting rain conditions to produce . an analog signal having an amplitude depending upon the detected rain conditions.

# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
* LED'S
* Switches
* timer
* Sensor
# HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
* SSD or hardware
* Windows operating system
* Embedded c
* arm based microcontroller
# ADVANTAGES
* It helps in saving money by switching off the irrigation system when it rains.
* This saves money by cutting off bills on electricity consumption.
* It extends life of rain sensor based systems such as car wiper, irrigation systems by running them only when it is necessary
# DISADVANTAGES
* The rain sensor based system functions when water falls on the sensor directly.
* The cost of overall system increases as additional components are needed along with rain sensor.
* In order to avoid false detection of rain, it requires rain sensors to take decision after few minutes.
# APPLICATIONS
* It is possible to operate manually/automatically providing on/off switch.
* Sensor cost is very low due to conductive sensor.
